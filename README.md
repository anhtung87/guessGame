# INTRODUCTION
This is my super mini game on iOS. I write this game for learning some feature
of Swift: guard let, if let, switch, UIKit, ...
## Rules:
1. You import a number between 1 to 100.
2. The Game picks a random between 1 to 100.
3. If you guess right number, you won.
4. If you guess wrong number, you lose. The Game will report your number is
   smaller or bigger than number which is random.

Thanks for reading.
